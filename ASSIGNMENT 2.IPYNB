    "Q1. How do you comment code in Python? What are the different types of comments?\n",
    "ANS:-Comments are essential for making your code more readable, understandable, and maintainable. They are lines of text that are ignored by the Python interpreter when the code is executed. There are three main types of comments in Python:\n",
    "Single-Line Comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the hash symbol (#) at the beginning of the line.\n",
    "Everything following the # symbol on that line is considered a comment.\n",

    "Q3. How do you convert one data type to another in Python?\n",
    "ANS:-Python offers two main ways to convert data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implicit Type Conversion (Automatic)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python interpreter automatically converts data types when necessary to perform operations. This happens when the data types involved are compatible.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Python\n",
    "x = 10  # Integer\n",
    "y = 3.14  # Float\n",
    "z = x + y  # Implicit conversion to float for arithmetic\n",
    "print(z)  # Output: 13.14 (float)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explicit Type Conversion (Manual)\n",
    "\n",
    "You control the conversion using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), bool(), etc.\n",
    "Common Functions:\n",
    "int(x): Converts x to an integer (e.g., float to int, string representing a number to int). If conversion is not possible (e.g., converting a string with non-numeric characters), a ValueError is raised.\n",
    "float(x): Converts x to a floating-point number (e.g., int to float, string representing a number to float). Similar to int(), it might raise a ValueError.\n",
    "str(x): Converts x to a string representation (e.g., int, float, bool, list, tuple, dictionary).\n",
    "bool(x): Converts x to a Boolean value (True or False). 0, empty strings, empty lists/tuples/dictionaries, and None evaluate to False, while other values are True.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "age_str = \"25\"\n",
    "age_int = int(age_str)  # Convert string to integer (assuming the string represents a valid number)\n",
    "print(age_int + 5)  # Now you can perform arithmetic operations on age\n",
    "\n",
    "pi_float = 3.14\n",
